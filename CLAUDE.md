# CLAUDE.md — condash (Electron)

Electron build of condash. As of 2026-04-27 this **is** the canonical condash — it lives at `vcoeur/condash` after the swap that moved the Tauri lineage to `vcoeur/condash-tauri`. The Tauri build remains buildable at that repo for as long as bug fixes are warranted.

## Stack

- **Main**: Node, TypeScript, **bundled with esbuild** (`scripts/build-electron.mjs`) to a single CJS file at `dist-electron/main/index.js`. Imports are inlined; ESM-only deps (chokidar 4, future libs) bundle to CJS transparently. Native modules (electron, node-pty, fsevents) stay external — they have to load from `node_modules` so `electron-rebuild` can reach them.
- **Preload**: same bundler, output at `dist-electron/preload/index.js`. Stays CJS because `webPreferences.sandbox: true` + ESM preload don't mix on Electron.
- **Typecheck**: `tsc -p tsconfig.main.json --noEmit` (and the renderer twin). `tsc` no longer emits — esbuild owns emission, tsc owns type-checking.
- **Renderer**: Solid + Solid signals, Vite (with `vite-plugin-solid`), plain CSS files + CSS variables, `src/renderer/main.tsx`.
- **Shared types**: `src/shared/types.ts` — plain serialisable objects, ISO strings, no methods.
- **Packaging**: electron-builder, single `BrowserWindow`, all modals/panes are in-renderer overlays.
- **Watcher**: single global chokidar rooted at `<conception>/`, debounced 250 ms.

### Adding a new main-process dep

1. `npm install <pkg>`. ESM-only is fine — esbuild bundles it as CJS.
2. If the dep is **native** (has a `binding.gyp` or ships prebuilt `.node` files — e.g. `node-pty`), add it to `scripts/shared/externals.mjs` (`SHARED_EXTERNALS`) so esbuild leaves it alone for both the Electron and CLI builds, and wire `electron-rebuild` if needed. Per-target externals (Electron-only or CLI-only) go in the per-script `EXTERNAL` array instead.
3. Pure-JS deps need no further work.

### Dependencies

#### `@xterm/*` beta pinning

The xterm v6 line only ships as `beta.NNN` prereleases on npm — there is no stable v6 yet. Every `@xterm/*` package therefore carries an **exact** pin (no caret), and all packages in the family must stay on the **same** `beta.NNN` minor so their internal peer ranges resolve. When bumping xterm:

- Pick the latest `beta.NNN` of `@xterm/xterm` and align every other `@xterm/*` package to the same `beta.NNN` in one commit.
- One known exception: `@xterm/addon-webgl@0.20.0-beta.NNN` declares a peer of `@xterm/xterm@^6.1.0-beta.(NNN+1)`, so the addon ends up one tag *behind* the rest of the family. This is upstream metadata, not a bug — accept the off-by-one until upstream tags catch up.
- `@xterm/addon-fit` and `@xterm/headless` still publish stable releases (`^0.11.0`, `^6.0.0`) and are excluded from the beta-pin sweep.

## Locked decisions

The load-bearing design choices — UI framework (Solid + Solid signals), styling (plain CSS files + CSS variables), IPC contract shape (single typed `CondashApi` in `src/shared/api.ts`), window architecture (single `BrowserWindow`, in-renderer overlays), data shape (plain serialisable objects in `src/shared/types.ts`), file-watching protocol (single global chokidar rooted at `<conception>/`, 250 ms debounce), config format (JSON: per-machine `settings.json` + per-conception `.condash/settings.json`, gitignored by default), and build tool (esbuild for main/preload, Vite for renderer) — are captured in this file and in [`docs/explanation/internals.md`](docs/explanation/internals.md). Treat them as locked: changing any of them is a PR with a dated rationale in the commit message, not a silent in-flight edit.

## Dev ports

- **5600** — Vite dev server.
- **5601** — Vite preview.
- Both `strictPort: true`. Defined in `vite.config.ts`. The numbers are picked from a 56xx block to stay clear of common defaults (3000, 5173, 5432, 8000, 8080) and of sibling vcoeur apps that bind their own host ports during dev.

When changing the dev port, update **every** file:

- `vite.config.ts` — `server.port`, `preview.port`.
- `Makefile` — `DEV_PORT`, `PREVIEW_PORT`.
- `src/main/index.ts` — `DEV_URL`.
- `src/renderer/index.html` — CSP `connect-src` (HMR websocket).
- `package.json` — `dev:electron` `wait-on tcp:<port>`.
- This file.

## Configuration

- **Per-machine**: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/condash/settings.json`. Owned by Electron's `app.getPath('userData')`, derived from `package.json`'s `name` field. JSON only. Sole owner of `lastConceptionPath` + `recentConceptionPaths` (cap 5); also carries global defaults for every workspace key.
- **Per-conception**: `<conception>/.condash/settings.json` (canonical). The whole `.condash/` directory is fully gitignored by default — settings included — so it carries per-host state with no commit-leak risk. Two legacy paths still read as fallbacks: `<conception>/condash.json` (old canonical) and `<conception>/configuration.json` (legacy²). Writes always target `.condash/settings.json`. The auto-migrator (`src/main/condash-dir-migrate.ts`) copies legacy content on first open, tombstones the source file, and appends `.condash/` to `.gitignore` when the conception is a git repo. `condash config migrate` exposes the same operation explicitly.
- **Per-conception logs**: `<conception>/.condash/logs/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMMSS-<sid>.txt`. **One single plain-text file per pty spawn** since v2.27.0 — no sidecar, no compression. Metadata travels inside the `.txt` as two `# condash: {...}` JSON lines: a header line at the top (always present, carries `{sid, side, repo?, cwd, cmd, argv, started}`) and a footer line at the bottom (only after `exit()`, carries `{finished, exitCode}`). `cat foo.txt` shows the metadata too. Gitignored alongside `settings.json`. **Opt-in** since 2.25.0 — `terminal.logging.enabled` defaults to `false`; flip it in `Settings → Terminal → Logging` to start recording. The pref is read once at session-start (writer construction). The writer (`src/main/terminal-logger.ts`) pipes pty bytes into a headless xterm (`@xterm/headless`), every 5 s renders the buffer row-by-row via `IBufferLine.translateToString(true)` (plain text — no SGR, no CSI, no cursor-forward), composes header + body (+ footer if exited), and atomically rewrites the `.txt`. Flushes are serialised through `flushChain` so `close()` can await every pending write before disposing the xterm. `in` keystrokes are *not* captured — the pty echoes them back through `out`. Session size is bounded by xterm scrollback (`terminal.logging.scrollback`, default 10000 lines); no rotation. Janitor (`src/main/terminal-logger-janitor.ts`) (1) evicts day-directories past `terminal.logging.retentionDays` (default 14), (2) evicts oldest-first while over `terminal.logging.maxDirMb` (default 500); runs at startup + every 24 h. The Logs working surface (`Cmd+Shift+L`) is now a **sessions list grouped by day** (`src/renderer/panes/logs.tsx`) — each row is a card showing time · repo · cmd · exit · size. Clicking a card opens `LogsViewerModal` (`src/renderer/logs-modal.tsx`): a full-overlay viewer with a virtualised plain-text transcript (fixed-row-height windowing over `lines.length * --logs-row-height` via an absolutely-positioned slice), a search box that pre-computes per-line hit indices and scrolls the active hit into view, and `Esc` to close. Long lines horizontal-scroll (no wrap) so the virtualizer's fixed-row-height math holds. Logs are also a source in the global search modal — `src/main/search/walk.ts:collectLogFiles` walks `<root>/YYYY/MM/DD/*.txt`; `src/main/search/match.ts` strips the `# condash:` header / footer lines via `splitContent` (exported from `src/main/logs-format.ts` — the pure-parsing module shared between the renderer-side `ipc/logs.ts`, the writer in `terminal-logger.ts`, and the CLI's search command; carved out so the CLI bundle's import graph doesn't touch `electron` or `@xterm/headless`) before substring matching, so snippets don't quote the JSON. Activating a log hit posts a `LogsOpenRequest` that opens the modal directly. Legacy `.jsonl` files from condash ≤ 2.22 and `.txt.gz` from 2.23–2.26 are ignored by the viewer — the janitor evicts them by age.
- `CONDASH_CONCEPTION_PATH` env var override: wired in both Electron (`src/main/settings.ts`) and CLI (`src/cli/conception.ts`). See [`docs/guides/configure-conception-path.md`](docs/guides/configure-conception-path.md) for the resolution chain. The conception-detector accepts any of the three recognised config files when validating a candidate path.
- The merge resolver lives in `src/main/effective-config.ts`. Every reader (`repos.ts`, `worktree-ops.ts`, `launchers.ts`, `audit.ts`, `terminals.ts`, `conception-paths.ts`, the CLI's `config` verbs) goes through it.
- **Merge rule**: top-level replace for every key, with **one exception**: `terminal` merges one level deep so a conception customising `terminal.logging` keeps the per-machine `terminal.screenshot_dir` / shortcuts. The exception is documented in `docs/reference/config.md` and tested in `effective-config.test.ts`.
- **Harness registry** (`src/shared/harnesses.ts`): the single source of truth for the three agent CLIs (`claude`, `kimi`, `opencode`). One pure module carries each harness's id / user-facing label (kimi's label is `kimi-cli`) / binary, its skills + AGENTS.md outputs (`COMPILE_TARGETS` and `AGENTS_MD_OUTPUTS` **derive** from it), and its `buildSpawn(def, resolveSecret)` adapter that turns an agent into `{ command, args, env, unsetEnv }`. Adding a fourth harness is one registry entry.
- **Tasks** are reusable, parameterized agent prompts. A task references an agent (by `slug`) + a markdown prompt with fillable `{markers}`, stored as one directory each at `<conception>/tasks/<slug>/`: `task.json` (`name` / `agent` (the agent's slug) / `submit`) + a hand-editable `prompt.md` (prose stays in markdown, config in JSON — the conception "never mix shapes" rule). Loaded by `src/main/tasks.ts` (mirrors `agents.ts`: ENOENT-tolerant `listTasks`, slug-validated writes via `isValidSlugTail`, idempotent `deleteTask`); IPC `listTasks` / `readTask` / `writeTask` / `deleteTask` (`src/main/ipc/tasks.ts`). The Tasks pane (`src/renderer/panes/tasks.tsx`) is a **left-band view** (`LeftView` adds `'tasks'`, ordered Projects · Tasks · Deliverables) — card list + a fill view (pickers + prefilled fields + live preview → Run) + an editor. Marker grammar + the `{APP_*}` / `{PROJECT_*}` reserved-token context builders live in `src/shared/tasks.ts` (`extractMarkers`, `appContext`, `projectTokenContext`); `substitute` (`src/shared/action-template.ts`) now honours `{KEY:default}` as a fallback (backward-compatible — existing `{token}`s still resolve). Run reuses the agent-spawn-and-type path: `terminal-bridge.ts`'s `runTask(agentSlug, text, submit)` spawns a fresh tab running the agent (cwd = conception root) and types the substituted prompt. The editor's agent select stores the agent `slug` and shows its display `name`; a dangling `agent` slug (renamed/removed) is flagged on the card (`agentPresent`) and disables Run.
- **Agents** replace the old tab-strip launchers (removed). An *agent* = a harness + a free-form display `name` + a stable lowercase-kebab `slug` (the identity) + a harness-specific config + an optional API token. Definitions live as one JSON file each at `<conception>/agents/<slug>.json` (loaded by `src/main/agents.ts`, validated with zod, **not** a `condash.json` key); the filename stem is authoritative for the slug (`readDefFromFile` pins it, so a slug can't drift from its file). The `name` is free (spaces and any case OK, no forced harness prefix); the `slug` is enforced lowercase-kebab on write (`isValidSlug`) and auto-suggested from the name as `<harness-label>-<slugified-name>` (`suggestSlug`), then frozen on edit so renaming the display name never moves the file. The *read* path guard (`safePathStem`) blocks only path-unsafe stems (separators / `..` / empty) — **not** spaces — so a legacy or hand-named file (e.g. `opencode-DeepSeek Auto.json`) still loads and launches; legacy files (pre-`name`/`slug`, carrying `modelVariant`) normalise in-memory on read and migrate on disk only when next written. Tokens live in gitignored `<conception>/agents/.env` (`NAME=value`) and are read **only in the main process** — the renderer sees token *presence* and `$SECRET_ENV` references, never values. The Agents pane (`src/renderer/panes/agents.tsx`, working surface `'agents'`) does CRUD + launch: each card carries only a **Launch** button and is itself click-to-edit (`role=button`; Launch `stopPropagation`s); Save/Cancel/**Delete** (the delete confirmed via `ConfirmModal`) live in the edit view, whose live "Will launch" panel replaced the old standalone read-only "view config". The tab-strip spawn dropdown lists agents by `name` and carries the `slug` as identity (`TermSpawnRequest.agentSlug` → `resolveAgentSpawn` → env merged into the child in `terminals.ts`). IPC: `listAgents` (each item carries a `command` preview line) / `readAgent` / `writeAgent` / `deleteAgent` / `previewAgent` / `readAgentsEnv` + `writeAgentsEnv` (the in-app token editor — the one place secret *values* reach the renderer, by explicit user action). Per-harness `buildSpawn` specifics: a claude agent with an empty `baseUrl` is "native" (runs bare `claude`, no env); opencode inlines its config via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` (no `opencode.json` needed — same trick as the `opencode-deepseek-auto` wrapper). The reasoning UI is a **single per-agent options table** — a `default` row (`model` + `defaultOptions: {reasoningEffort?, textVerbosity?, reasoningSummary?}` applied to every agent) and `agentOptions: {agent, model?, reasoningEffort?, textVerbosity?, reasoningSummary?}[]` rows that override the model and/or options per agent. `buildOpencodeSpawn` translates the table into **plain model options** (`setModelOptions`): the default row → the default model's base `options` (`provider.<id>.models.<model>.options`, inherited by every agent on that model, incl. unlisted subagents); each per-agent row → `agent.<name>.options` (+ `agent.<name>.model`), which opencode layers over the model base (`agent.options` wins — wire-verified). A model-only row carries the default options onto its model (the default model's base options don't reach a different model). **Not** variants: opencode's footer reflects only the live ctrl+t-selected variant, never `agent.<name>.variant`, so variants bought nothing here — plain options are simpler, reach the request identically, and the default is truly global. (History: variant-based in v3.31.0–v3.33.0, reverted to options in v3.34.0; retired keys `buildModel`/`planModel`/`effortLevel`/`reasoningOverrides`/`variants`/`defaultVariant`/`agentOverrides` are stripped on read.) Plus an `extraConfigJson` merge underneath. kimi-cli adds `--model` / `--thinking` / `--plan` / inline `--config` alongside `--agent-file`. Agent args are POSIX-quoted in `terminals.ts` (`quoteArg`) so inline-config JSON survives shell wrapping. Migration: `migrateRawSettings()` drops legacy `terminal.launchers` / `launcher_command` and renames action-template `launcher` → `agent`.

## Sandbox: dev vs. production

- **Dev** (`make dev`) — `dev:electron` passes `--no-sandbox`. Avoids the per-worktree `sudo chown root chrome-sandbox` ritual. The dev window only loads `http://localhost:5600` and local `file://` URLs, so the threat surface is local-only.
- **Production** (`make package`) — `electron-builder` SUIDs the helper at install time on `.deb` and AppImage; the sandbox is on for end users.

If you want the sandbox on during dev anyway: drop `--no-sandbox` from `dev:electron` in `package.json` and run once per worktree:

```bash
sudo chown root node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
```

macOS and Windows are unaffected.

## Conventions

- Run `make format` after every code change.
- All UI must work without per-OS CSS branches (Electron + Chromium = same renderer everywhere).
- In-window drag must use pointer events (`pointerdown` / `pointermove` / `pointerup` + `setPointerCapture`), never HTML5 drag-and-drop — Chromium's Wayland Ozone backend (forced for crisp text on Wayland sessions) silently breaks HTML5 DnD. The Projects-pane status drag follows this; terminal-tab and settings-row reorder are still HTML5 DnD (broken on Wayland) until converted. See [internals invariant 8](docs/explanation/internals.md#8-in-window-drag-uses-pointer-events-not-html5-drag-and-drop).
- File-path conventions: every path crossing the IPC boundary is normalised to forward-slash form via `toPosix(p)` from `src/shared/path.ts`. Internal `fs` calls keep the native separator (use `path.join`); the renderer can then split on `/` without per-OS branches. Cross-OS shell wrapping (`bash -lc` / `cmd.exe /d /s /c` / `pwsh -Command`) lives in `src/main/terminals.ts`'s `wrapForShell`.
- Spawned-process PATH: every pty / child process condash spawns takes its PATH from `spawnEnv()` in `src/main/shell-env.ts`, which resolves the user's **login-shell PATH** once at boot (`$SHELL -lic`, cached, 5 s timeout) so GUI-launched condash (Wayland / macOS — no `~/.profile` sourcing) still finds user-installed CLIs (`opencode`, `~/bin` wrappers). PATH only; other vars keep inherited values so the env-hygiene scrub stays intact. Wired into `terminals.ts` (pty + `force_stop`) and `launchers.ts`; warmed in `index.ts` at `whenReady`.
- Renderer CSP carries `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` (`src/renderer/index.html`) for `@xterm/addon-image` — its Sixel decoder is WebAssembly, which Chromium refuses to compile under a bare `'self'`. The refusal throws inside xterm's synchronous write loop, blanking any terminal that receives an inline-image escape (e.g. the opencode TUI). `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` permits WASM compilation only, **not** JS `eval` / `new Function` — keep it; do not widen to `'unsafe-eval'`.
- IPC contract is the single typed `CondashApi` interface in `src/shared/api.ts`. Functions, not URLs. Promises for request/response; events only for chokidar push.
- Hard interaction-to-paint budget: **≤ 16 ms** for any user-initiated action. Optimistic UI is the default; rollback on IPC failure.

## Pointers

- **Public site**: [`condash.vcoeur.com`](https://condash.vcoeur.com) — built from `docs/` + `mkdocs.yml` by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on every published release. Includes a signed apt repo at `condash.vcoeur.com/apt/`, indexed against the **most-recent `APT_HISTORY` releases** (5 by default; tune in `docs.yml` env). Older `.deb` assets stay reachable from each release's GitHub page; only the apt index is windowed.
- [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) — landing page of both the in-app Help menu and the public mkdocs site.
- [`docs/explanation/internals.md`](docs/explanation/internals.md) — invariants: drift checks, atomic writes, write queue, TTL cache, pty kill pipeline, IPC contract.
- [`docs/reference/config.md`](docs/reference/config.md) — `condash.json` + `settings.json` schema + per-key reference, including the override model.
- [`docs/explanation/non-goals.md`](docs/explanation/non-goals.md) — explicit non-goals; **read before adding "while we're at it" features**.

The in-app Help menu reads files out of the asar via the allowlist in `src/main/help.ts`. The allowlist carries six short names — `welcome`, `quick-start`, `shortcuts`, `configuration`, `cli`, `why-markdown` — each mapping to `docs/help/<name>.md`. Separate menu items link out to `condash.vcoeur.com` and the issue tracker via `shell.openExternal`. There is no separate copy at the repo root — the migration shipped in `v2.0.6`.

The first-launch **welcome screen** lives in `src/renderer/welcome-screen.tsx` and renders inside `workspace-center` when the conception path is set, the projects list is empty, and the knowledge tree is empty (and the user hasn't dismissed it). Dismiss state persists at `welcome.dismissed` in `settings.json` via the `getWelcomeDismissed` / `setWelcomeDismissed` IPC verbs.

The Code pane's **branch filter** (top-of-pane popover) shows every worktree by default; ticking branches narrows each card to "primary + ticked branches". Unticking everything returns to the default "show all" view. The primary worktree row (the checkout under `workspace_path`) is always rendered with a subtly tinted background. Hydration + persistence go through `createBranchFilterStore` in `src/renderer/branch-filter-store.ts` and the `getSelectedBranches` / `setSelectedBranches` IPC verbs (settings.json field: `selectedBranches`). Filter logic is the pure `filterWorktrees` in `src/renderer/panes/code-parts/data.ts`.

When changing app behaviour, update the matching `docs/` file in the same commit. The schema in `src/main/config-schema.ts` and the public reference (`docs/reference/config.md`) must agree on every release.
