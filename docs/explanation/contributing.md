# Contributing

> **Audience.** Developer — first-time contributor or returning developer who needs a refresher on the workflow.

condash is a single-developer project, but the codebase is designed to welcome outside contributions. This page is the on-ramp: clone, build, run, test, ship a change.

If you want the design rationale rather than the workflow, read [Values](values.md) and [Non-goals](non-goals.md) first.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** — exact minor doesn't matter; CI tests against 20.x.
- **`git`** on `PATH`. condash shells out for status / worktree info; the build also uses it.
- **A C/C++ toolchain** for native modules (currently `node-pty`):
  - Linux — `build-essential python3 libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev`.
  - macOS — Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
  - Windows — Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+ with the C++ workload.
- **An editor or IDE** of your choice. The repo is plain TypeScript + CSS; any modern editor works. The codebase has no `.vscode/` settings to import.

That's it. No framework boilerplate, no per-developer config.

## Clone, install, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vcoeur/condash.git
cd condash
make install      # one-off — npm install + electron-rebuild
make dev          # watch mode: tsc + vite + electron with --no-sandbox
```

`make dev` runs three processes concurrently:

- `tsc --watch` typechecks `src/main/` and `src/renderer/` continuously. No emit — esbuild handles bundling.
- `vite` serves the renderer at `localhost:5600`. Hot module reload works for the renderer.
- `electron` opens a single `BrowserWindow` against the dev URL. Main / preload changes restart on the next launch (`Ctrl+R` on the dev window).

If port 5600 is in use, `make kill` frees it. Add or change ports? See the dev-port checklist in [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/vcoeur/condash/blob/main/AGENTS.md).

## Project layout

```
src/
├── main/         # Electron main process. fs, IPC handlers, watchers, mutations.
├── preload/      # contextBridge — exposes window.condash typed as CondashApi.
├── renderer/     # Solid SPA. Components, signals, Markdown rendering, modals.
├── shared/       # Types + IPC contract. Imported by all three layers.
└── cli/          # The condash CLI (since v2.4.0). Same binary, different argv.

scripts/          # Build glue. esbuild entry point, electron-builder helpers.
docs/             # This documentation site.
tests/            # Playwright E2E + Vitest unit tests.
conception-template/  # Skills + sample tree shipped via `condash skills install`.
```

Three TS configs:

- `tsconfig.main.json` — main + preload + cli.
- `tsconfig.renderer.json` — renderer.
- `tsconfig.json` — shared + tooling.

Each config is checked independently. `make typecheck` runs both. esbuild does the actual emission for main + preload + cli; vite handles the renderer.

## How a feature lands

A typical feature touches three layers in sequence:

1. **`src/shared/api.ts`** — add the IPC verb signature to the `CondashApi` interface. Plain serialisable inputs and outputs (no functions, no Date objects, ISO strings).
2. **`src/main/`** — implement the handler. Register it in `src/main/index.ts:registerIpc` as a single-line `ipcMain.handle('verb', impl)`.
3. **`src/preload/index.ts`** — add a one-liner: `verb: (...args) => ipcRenderer.invoke('verb', ...args)`.
4. **`src/renderer/`** — call it through `window.condash.verb(...)`.

Because `CondashApi` is a single typed interface, the compiler will refuse to build until all four layers agree. There is no string-mux'd action layer where a typo silently no-ops.

The `invoke`/`handle` channel name equals the `CondashApi` method name, so the typed interface anchors it on both sides. The **main → renderer push-event** channels (`tree-events`, `termData`, `menu-command`, …) have no such anchor — they are bare strings repeated between `webContents.send(...)` in main and `ipcRenderer.on(...)` in preload — so they live as named constants in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts` (`EVENT_CHANNELS`). Reference that map from both ends rather than re-typing the literal.

For renderer-only features (UI states, animations, derived signals), only the renderer changes.

## Testing

```bash
make typecheck     # tsc --noEmit on both projects
make test          # build, then the Playwright E2E suite
make test-unit     # vitest unit tests
make deadcode      # knip — dead files / deps / duplicate exports
```

- **Vitest** (`make test-unit`) — `src/**/*.test.ts`. Fast. Pure-function tests (parsers, path helpers, regexes). `environment: 'node'`.
- **knip** (`make deadcode`) — the dead-code / over-export guard, configured in `knip.json`. It fails the build on dead source files, dead / unlisted / unresolved dependencies, and duplicate exports (the grade that keeps re-added back-compat aliases and orphaned modules out). The pre-existing unused-export / unused-type backlog is graded `warn`: reported for a future sweep, but non-failing. The intentionally-tracked-but-unimported `electron-updater` dependency is allowlisted in `knip.json`. This check is part of the light gate, so it runs on every PR.
- **Playwright** (`make test`) — `tests/*.spec.ts`. Drives the real Electron app. Slower, more authoritative. The Playwright fixture launches Electron with `CONDASH_FORCE_PROD=1` so the renderer loads the real `dist/` build, not the Vite dev server.

For a feature that touches the dashboard's behaviour, prefer Playwright. The e2e suite seeds a temporary conception tree, exercises the feature, and asserts on real DOM + real file writes.

Driving the real Electron app means the suite opens an on-screen window unless it runs against a virtual display. On Linux, `make test` wraps the suite in `xvfb-run` when it's installed, so the window never appears or steals focus — the same thing CI does. `make test-headless` forces that wrap (and errors if `xvfb-run` is missing); `make test-visible` runs with the window visible when you want to watch a run. On macOS/Windows (no `xvfb`), `make test` runs visibly.

On a Wayland session there's a catch: the shell exports `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=wayland` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and Electron honours those over the virtual X `DISPLAY` that `xvfb-run` provides — so the window would still open on the real compositor and steal focus despite the wrap. The wrapped targets therefore drop `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and pin `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=x11` for the run, forcing Electron to render into Xvfb. `make test-visible` keeps Wayland on purpose.

## Style and conventions

- **`make format`** runs Prettier across `src/`. Run it before every commit. CI fails on unformatted code.
- **No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious.** Names already say *what*. See [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/vcoeur/condash/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for the longer version.
- **Don't add features beyond what the task requires.** Bug fixes don't need surrounding cleanup. Three similar lines beats a premature abstraction.
- **Small commits, descriptive subjects.** Imperative mood, ≤72 characters.
- **One PR per logical change.** A 30-line PR with one review cycle ships faster than a 300-line PR that needs three.
- **Config key casing is frozen.** The settings surface (`settings.json` / `condash.json`) mixes two casings for historical reasons and existing keys are never renamed (a rename is a breaking settings migration). A *new* key takes **snake_case** in the repo-entry / terminal-shell vocabulary (anything under `repositories[]`, the `terminal.xterm` block, the open-with slots) and **camelCase** for app/UI preference keys (everything else). A new key in an existing group follows that group's casing; when genuinely unsure for a new group, prefer camelCase. Never introduce kebab-case, PascalCase, or SCREAMING_SNAKE. A unit guard in `config-schema.test.ts` enforces snake-or-camel on every top-level key; the rule itself is documented in `config-schema.ts`'s header.

## What the build pipeline produces

```
make build       # → dist-electron/main/index.js, dist-electron/preload/index.js, dist/
make package     # → release/{*.AppImage, *.deb, *.dmg, *.exe, latest*.yml}
```

Native modules (`electron`, `node-pty`) stay external — esbuild leaves them as `require()` calls so they load from `node_modules`. `electron-rebuild` rebuilds them against the bundled Electron's Node ABI; `electron-builder` runs it again at package time.

CI follows a two-gate model: a **light gate** on every PR and every push to `main`, and a **real gate** that runs the full suite on the exact commit being published. Three reusable workflows — `_fast.yml`, `_playwright.yml`, `_build.yml` — carry the actual work, so the build matrix (and its AppImage AppRun patch) lives in exactly one place.

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** is the light gate, and the only CI that runs on a PR. It runs on every `pull_request` to `main` (including drafts) and on every `push` to `main`. One Ubuntu job via `_fast.yml`: `prettier --check` + `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` + `npx vitest run` + `npx knip` (the dead-code guard). Target ≤ 90 s, so iterating on a PR stays cheap. No Playwright, no installer build. Its `ci-light-gate` aggregator is the **only** required check.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** runs only on `v*` tag push, and is where the Playwright suite and the 3-OS installer matrix actually run. `validate-tag` checks tag shape + tag SHA reachable from `origin/main` — the version is **tag-derived**, so `_build.yml` injects `${TAG#v}` into `package.json` before electron-builder and there is no committed version to match; then the suite runs **inline on the tagged commit** in sequence — `_fast.yml` → `_playwright.yml` → `_build.yml` — and only if all three pass does `publish` create the Release and upload the installers. The suite is run for real against whatever is tagged; there is no commit-status stamp to read and no requirement to tag any particular commit. Sequencing the lanes means a cheap format/type error aborts before the expensive Playwright and 3-OS matrix start.

Because the heavy suite runs only at tag time, Playwright and 3-OS build regressions surface there rather than on the PR — run `make test` and `make package` locally before tagging if you want earlier signal. A tag whose commit is broken is caught before any Release is created: the failing lane stops the pipeline and `publish` never runs, so the tag stays in git but nothing public ships. The Windows installer leg is the load-bearing build check: `build/installer.nsh`'s NSIS hooks only assemble into the full installer template when `electron-builder` runs, so NSIS warning 6010 (treated as an error) only surfaces in the matrix.

The only check to require in branch protection is the aggregator job **`ci-light-gate`** — not the inner `fast` check. `ci.yml` filters at the job level (a `changes` job skips the fast lane for docs/assets-only PRs) and ends in an always-running gate job that reports success when its lane succeeded *or* was skipped. Requiring the gate (rather than an inner check that simply doesn't report on a skipped docs-only PR) keeps required checks from wedging trivial PRs in a permanent "Expected" state.

## Documentation changes

This documentation site lives at `docs/` in the same repo. The mkdocs nav is at `mkdocs.yml`. To preview locally:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve     # → http://localhost:8000
```

Conventions:

- Every page declares its **Audience** at the top, immediately under the H1.
- Diátaxis layout: tutorials teach, guides solve, reference looks up, explanation explains.
- Cross-link to neighbouring pages.
- Source-of-truth fields (config keys, IPC verbs, exit codes) are tested against the code in CI: if the docs diverge, the test fails.

Every code change that affects user-visible behaviour ships with a docs update in the same commit.

## Issues, PRs, releases

- **Issues** — file at [`github.com/vcoeur/condash/issues`](https://github.com/vcoeur/condash/issues). For bugs, include the OS, the condash version (footer of the dashboard), and a minimal repro tree if you can.
- **PRs** — branch from `main`, open a PR against `main`. The PR template asks for a Summary, a Changes list, and an optional Impact / Watchpoints section.
- **Releases** — tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. PATCH for bug fixes and docs; MINOR for new behaviour; MAJOR for breaking config or Markdown changes. The version is derived from the tag — **no version-bump commit**; push the tag on a merged commit and `release.yml`'s `publish` job runs automatically (gated behind the heavy CI matrix).

## What to work on

Three good places to start:

1. **Issues tagged `good first issue`** at the issue tracker.
2. **Pages tagged "stub" or "TODO"** in this docs tree — search the source for `TODO` and `<!-- stub -->`.
3. **A feature you want yourself.** condash exists because someone wanted it; the next feature probably will too.

Before starting on anything large, open an issue with the proposed approach and link to the values it serves. A 200-word issue saves a 2000-word PR rewrite.
